<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Aspiring Programmer</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Juan and I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from WGU. I created this website to showcase my projects as well as practice HTML.</p>

<p>Initially, I enrolled in the Computer Science program because I understood it had rigorous coursework, and I liked pushing myself academically. 
    During the latter half of my degree, most of my courses were project-based and I began enjoying the planning and implementation of these projects. 
    My capstone required me to utilize machine learning to solve a business problem, real or fictional. My capstone earned me a Capstone Excellence Award from WGU.
    After I graduated, I wanted to continue programming, so I began reviewing Java since I had been using Python primarily the past year. Alongside that, I 
    also wanted to learn web development so I signed up and started the web dev course on FreeCodeCamp, and created a learning path in Udemy. 
</p>

<p>I love learning new things, and believe it is imperative to keep learning to be successful. 
    
    One of the most important advice that I've recieved: <b>Getting in the habit of programming or creating is key, even when it's not a whole lot of fun.</b></p>
